Remember that your project, toolchain and sdk must be in the same disk.
Create a cmakelist in your cmake list root directory. Can be copied from another project, just change "PROJ_TO_SDK_PATH".

Open POWERSHELL and go to project root dir:
$env:Path="Z:\bill_\Documents\workspace\KendryteProjects\kendryte-toolchain\bin;Z:\Program Files\CMake\bin" +  $env:Path
mkdir build 
cd build

On build dir:
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../
make

Use kflash to upload binary to k210
